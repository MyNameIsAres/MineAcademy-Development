DO NOT REQUEST SUPPORT FOR OLDER VERSIONS OF MINECRAFT.

Please include the following information in all bug reports:

* Minecraft Development for IntelliJ plugin version
* IntelliJ version
* Operating System (this has come up enough times to be worth noting)
* (optional) Target platform, if relevant
  * E.g., Bukkit, Forge, Mixin, etc

Always include a stack trace if there is one. Otherwise, the more information you can provide in terms of how to reproduce the problem, the more likely it'll be fixed. If there is something specific about your project, a link to the GitHub project can be very helpful.
