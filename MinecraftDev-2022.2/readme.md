MineAcademy Development for IntelliJ
==================================


 
Info and Documentation
----------------------
This project is a fork of the fantastic Intellij plugin [**MineCraft Development**](https://github.com/minecraft-dev/MinecraftDev)
MineAcademy Development is an Intellij plugin based off Minecraft Development to help Minecraft plugin developers by providing
them with extra tooling  to increase their development productivity.

Please check the Projects tab for more information about upcoming features!

Installation
------------
The ultimate goal is to have this project on the Intellij Plugin Marketplace. As it currently stands the project will be on Github
and move to the Intellij Plugin Marketplace when it's in a more mature state.

Download the zip folder from the Releases tab. Go to your Intellij settings. Navigate to `Plugins -> Installed` and select the settings icon just to the right of "Installed".
Click on `Install Plugin from Disk...` and select the zip folder. Restart your IDE and enjoy!

Credits & Disclaimer

This Intellij plugin would not have been possible without the incredible work done by the developers and contributors from
Minecraft Development. I am not claiming to be the original author of their work and this plugin is only possible because 
of their work. 

It is my understanding that this project does not violate any license from MineCraft Development. 

As it currently stands this plugin may not be fully compatible with Minecraft Development as we both share the Minecraft Facet.
